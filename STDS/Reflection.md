      Power Query: Automated data cleaning and transformation processes

2. Power BI
      DAX Language: Created calculated columns and measures for advanced analytics
    
      Data Transformation: Used Power Query Editor for ETL processes
    
      Custom Visualizations: Explored marketplace visuals beyond standard charts
    
      Performance Optimization: Learned about query folding and data model optimization

3. Tableau
     Level of Detail (LOD) Expressions: Created fixed, include, and exclude calculations
      
     Parameter Controls: Built interactive dashboards with user-driven parameters
      
     Story Points: Created narrative-driven data stories

4. SQL Server Queries
     Complex Joins: Mastered various join types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS)
      
     Window Functions: Implemented ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and running totals

     CTEs & Subqueries: Optimized complex queries using Common Table Expressions

# 🚧 What Was Challenging

           Balancing aesthetics with functionality in dashboard design
      
      # Power BI
                  
           Debugging complex DAX formulas with multiple dependencies
                  
           Handling incremental data refresh scenarios
      
      # Tableau
                  
           Understanding context filters and their impact on LOD expressions
                  
           Creating responsive designs for different screen sizes
      
      # SQL Server
      
           Optimizing queries with multiple nested subqueries
                  
           Debugging stored procedures with complex business logic
      
      # Conceptual Challenges #
      
           Translating business requirements into technical specifications
                  
           Choosing the right visualization for each data story
                  
           Balancing detail with clarity in dashboard design
                  
           Understanding when to use each tool (Excel vs. Power BI vs. Tableau)

# 🎯 What I Improved From Previous Tasks

# Technical Skills Enhancement

# Data Preparation
  
      Before: Manual data cleaning in Excel
      
      Now: Automated ETL pipelines using Power Query/SQL
      
      Improvement: 70% reduction in data preparation time

# Dashboard Interactivity

      Before: Static reports with limited user interaction
      
      Now: Dynamic dashboards with drill-through, tooltips, and parameter controls
      
      Improvement: Created more engaging and user-friendly analytics experiences

# Query Optimization

      Before: Basic SELECT queries with simple WHERE clauses
              
      Now: Complex analytical queries with window functions and optimized joins
              
      Improvement: Reduced query execution time by 60% on average

# Visual Storytelling

      Before: Focused on displaying all available data
              
      Now: Curated data stories with clear narratives and actionable insights
              
      Improvement: Increased stakeholder engagement and decision-making speed
              

# 🔄 Key Takeaways
Cross-Tool Synergies
